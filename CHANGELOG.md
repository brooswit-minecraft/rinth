# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). CI
enforces that this file has a `## [<version>]` heading matching the
`version` field in `package.json` — see README.md.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Bun project scaffold: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, oxlint, and the
  `typecheck` / `lint` / `test` / `test:coverage` scripts.
- `@modrinth/api-client` pinned as an exact dependency.
- CLI entrypoint (`src/cli.ts`) with `--json` / `--help` parsing and an
  empty command registry, plus seams for the transport, output, error, and
  auth layers that T2 will implement.
- Unit tests and an integration test harness under `test/integration` that
  skips cleanly when `MODRINTH_TOKEN` is unset.
- GitHub Actions CI: typecheck, lint, unit tests, an 80% coverage gate, a
  changelog/version gate, and a separate integration job.
